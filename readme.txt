DESCRIPTION

Monopoly is a two-player, text-based adaptation of Monopoly, the board game.

---------------------------------------

COMPLING INSTRUCTIONS

Monopoly: A Wan-Z Production should be played on a full screen terminal for your viewing pleasure.

---------------------------------------

HOW TO

Each player is presented with a menu at the beginning of his/her turn. This menu allows the player to roll, mortgage/unmortgage properties, buy houses/hotels, trade, view his/her properties, and view the board. When a player lands on an unowned property, he/she will have the option to buy the property, or to not buy the property. Trades with the other player can only be property for property, property for money, or money for property. The game is over once one player goes bankrupt.

NOTE:
For your testing and cheating convenience, the "cheat code" to set your location to any valid index is 13.  Just type 13 into the main menu and then enter the index you want to be on.
